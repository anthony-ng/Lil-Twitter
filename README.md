# Sinatra Group Projects

## Learning Competencies

* Build a fully functional web application from scratch
* Use agile development techniques

## Summary

Good news: you're a web developer now. And here's your chance to prove it.
We're going to be building a fully functional web application from scratch. And
we're going to do it in teams, using the Agile development process.

## Releases

### Release 1: Deciding on your project and MVP

You have a choice of two possible projects to work on: building your own version
of Twitter, or building a flashcards program. Here are some possible user stories
for both:

**Lil' Twitter**
> * A user can log in
> * A user can retweet others' status updates
> * A user can see others' profile pages with all their updates
> * A user can only post status updates of 140 characters or less
> * A user can post status updates
> * A user can follow other users
> * A user sees a styled site
> * A user has followers
> * A user can see a list of their followers
> * A user can see a list of who they are following
> * A user can see updates from those they are following
> * A user sees a responsively styled site
> * A user can see others' profile pages
> * A user can link a gravatar image
> * A user has a profile page
> * Add your own user stories

**Flashcards**
> * A user can choose which deck to use
> * A user can create their own deck
> * A user can see a single flashcard
> * A user sees a styled site
> * A user sees a responsively styled site
> * A user can see all their past scores
> * A user can play a "round," which is a series of guesses over all the cards in a deck
> * A user can make a guess on a single flashcard
> * A user is told if they make an incorrect guess
> * A user can skip a flashcard
> * A user can log in
> * A user skips a flashcard if they guess incorrectly too many times
> * A user receives a score at the end of the game
> * A user can see a high score table
> * A user can guess on skipped flashcards after running through the deck once
> * A user sees a single, hard-coded deck
> * Add your own user stories

Before you start coding, decide what your Minimum Viable Product is. What are
the features that are absolutely necessary? Declare your MVP in your README.md
file, which should be your first commit.

### Release 2: Build it!

It's time to build this thing. Start a repository on GitHub, add your teammates
as collaborators, and get to work.

We've built [a Sinatra MVC Skeleton]((https://github.com/fiery-skippers-2014/sinatra-skeleton-mvc-challenge)) that may be helpful as a starting point.

Be intentional about your workflow. Are you going to work solo or in pairs? How
are you going to do to code review? How do you plan on communicating with each
other? How are you going to handle deployment? How are you going to split the
project up so that you aren't constantly overwriting each other's code?

### Release 3: Prioritize and add new features

Once you've finished your MVP, its time to start working on new features. Decide
as a team which features you prioritize. No feature is considered complete until
its implemented accross the entire stack, its fully tested, and its deployed to
production.
